Steps to preparing the HOST PC and install Yocto:

1) download Ubuntu 14.04.4
2) download VirtualBox and setup Virtual Machine (VM)
3) install Ubuntu 14.04.4 in your VM
4) check that VM is connected to internet (mandatory)
5) install git with the command: sudo apt-get install git
6) clone tools repo with the command: git clone https://github.com/ROJ-ITALY/tools.git -b krogoth (*1)
7) change dir to tools (cd tools) and run these scripts in this order:
	a) ./download_packages
	b) ./create-yocto-environment

Steps to configuring Yocto first time:

1) set up the right environment for the build:
	a) cd $HOME/yocto-roj-demokit-krogoth
	b) MACHINE=mx6qroj source ./setup-environment build_mx6qroj (*2)

Steps to build your first image:

Now that you're ready to start the compilation, launch the build of the three basic components of a linux embedded system: bootloader, kernel, filesystem. This build includes many tasks and the first time will take about 1 hour on a virtual machine based on an i7 CPU.
In your Yocto environment, run the command: bitbake core-image-minimal
Once the build finished, you will find the output images under: $HOME/yocto-roj-demokit-krogoth/build_mx6qroj/tmp/deploy/images/mx6qroj

Transfer the root file system (core-image-minimal just compiled)

1) SD
In order to transfer the image to a SD card, plug a SD card reader with your SD on HOST PC and follow the next steps changing sdX for your detected device:

	cd $HOME/yocto-roj-demokit-krogoth/build_mx6qroj/tmp/deploy/images/mx6qroj
	gunzip -k core-image-minimal-mx6qroj-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx.rootfs.sdcard.gz
	sudo dd if=core-image-minimal-mx6qroj-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx.rootfs.sdcard of=/dev/sdX bs=10M
	sync
2) eMMC
In order to transfer the image to eMMC, you can use Manufacturing Tool customized for our iMx6 platforms (quad/dual and solo) by ROJ.

---------------------	
Note:
(*1) tools dir contains some useful shell scripts in order to prepare the Host system to use Yocto Project.
(*2) in order to compile for SMARC based on "iMx6 solo" use this command: MACHINE=mx6sroj source ./setup-environment build_mx6sroj. ATTENTION: You have to specify MACHINE name just the first time.
